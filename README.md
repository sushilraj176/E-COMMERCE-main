### Technologies used:

- **ReactJS**
- **Redux toolkit** for state management
- **Material-UI** for styling and components
- **React Router** for routing

---

### Challenges:

Getting accustomed to **Redux** workflow was rather intimidating at first. It was difficult to wrap my head around all the boilerplate code necessary to even begin doing something. I chose to deep-dive into the Redux official documentation to
get a better understanding, and eventually it started to make
more sense.

I had never worked with a UI framework before either and it felt
strange not having to build everything from scratch. I learned
that the best way to understand the Material-UI ecosystem better
was just to implement components in my project and try to
customize them.
